        //Parameterized tests let you run the same test method multiple times with
        // different input values. Instead of writing many similar test methods for
        // different data, you write one test and supply it with various inputs. This helps
        // reduce code duplication and makes your tests easier to maintain.
        //Example:
        //Suppose you want to test if a number is even. Instead of writing separate tests for
        //2, 4, and 6, you can use a parameterized test to check all these numbers in one
        //method.
